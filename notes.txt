    CoordinateInOrder: the order of coordiantes in smss system. the order 
might be different from the order in CoordinateSet 



length: MuscleLength = TendonLength + FiberLengthAlongTendon 
        f(MuscleLength/OptimalMuscleLength) = ForceLengthMultiplier 
Force: TendonForce = FiberForceAlongTendon
        FiberForce = ActiveFiberForce + PassiveFiberForce
          


model.equilibrateMuscles:
    stabilize the muscle dynmaic, the fiber velocity converge to 0
    fiber velocity do not equal to coordinate velocity.
